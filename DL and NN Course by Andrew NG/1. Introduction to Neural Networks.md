# 1. Introduction to Neural Networks:

Objectives of this course: Neural Networks and Deep learning. To build a Neural Network.

- A Neuron (Node) is a mathematical function which receives an input, processes them, and produces an output.
A Neural Network is a computational model inspired by human brain, it consists of interconnected neurons organized in layers that process data to perform a certain task.
- ReLU Function: Rectified Linear Unit. f(x) = max(0,x). gradient = 1 ∀ positive values.
- Supervised Learning: map input data to a specific output based on a training dataset
each input is paired with its corresponding output label.
few examples of supervised learning with Neural Networks: 
input(x), output(y) and application
i. predicting real estate prices given the home features (standard NN)
ii. speech recognition to predict text transcript given an audio input (RNN)
iii. CV: photo tagging (CNN)
- Structured Data v/s Unstructured Data
- Deep Learning Progress: performance of a NN ∝ size of NN and amount of  labeled data.
m = number of training data.
- Objective of course: Basics of NN Programming, One hidden layer NN, DNN.
